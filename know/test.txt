- CTRL-K deletes all text from the cursor to the end of the line. --- OK
- CTRL-X and then space deletes all text to the beginning of the line. --- OK
- CTRL-T transposes the the selected character with the one before the cursor. --- OK
- ESC-T transposes two words immediately before the cursor. --- OK
- ESC-U converts all text from the cursor to the end of the word to uppercase. --- OK
- ESC-L converts all text from the cursor to the end of the word to lowercase. --- OK
- ESC-C converts the letter under the cursor to uppercase. --- OK
- CTRL-X CTRL-E the bash attemps to launch the editor defined by $FCEDIT or $EDITOR  --- OK
- Environment variables are like programs' variable they hold data to be referred by the variable name. They differ from programs' variable since they are relative to the shell enviroment.  --- OK
- $TERM environment variable contains information about the capabilities of the current terminal. --- OK
- $PATH environment provides the shell with a directory list to search for commands typed in the command line. --- OK
- man is the Linux helping system. (short for Manual). --- OK

-- A stream is a data entity that can be manipulated --- OK
- Linux handles everything as a file. --- OK
- file descriptors :  --- OK
-  STDIN file descriptors is 0. Usually is the input from a keybord. --- OK
-  STDOUT file descriptor is 1. Programs sends data to the user via stdout. --- OK
-  STDERR file descriptor is 2. Is sent together with STDOUT, but they can be handled indipendently.  --- OK
- Common redirection operators  --- OK
-  >   Creates a new file containing stdout overwriting the file if it already exists. --- OK
-  >>  Appends stdout to the existing file, the file is created if it does not exist. --- OK
-  2>  Create a new file containing stderr overwriting the file if it already exists. --- OK
-  2>> Appends stderr to the existing file, the file is created if it does not exit.  --- OK
-  &>  Creates a new file containing both stderr and stdout.   --- OK
-  <   Sends the content of the specified file to be used stdin. No file descriptor necessary.   --- OK
-  <<  Accepts text on the folloing lines a s tandar input. No file descriptor necessary.  --- OK
-  <>  Causes the specified file to be used for both standard input and standard output. No file descriptor necessary. --- OK
   --- OK
- A pipe redirects a first program stdout to a second program stdin. Example synthax program1 | program2 --- OK
- tee : command redirects output both to a file and to a pipe. --- OK
- xargs : builds and executs commands from the standar input.  --- OK
- backstik ` can be used in a similar manner as xargs example rm `find ./ -user srg` or rm $(find -user srg) --- OK
- byte : is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. --- OK
- cat : command is short for concatenate. It links together an arbitrary number of file and sends the result to the stdout. --- OK
- join : combines two file by matching the contents of specified fields within the files. --- OK
- paste : merges files line by line, separating the lines from each file with tabs. --- OK
- expand : converts tabs to spaces. --- OK
- od : octal dump it displays files in an unambhiguous format. --- OK
- sort : the file record in several ways. --- OK
- split : command can split a file into one or more pieces. --- OK

- hexdump, hd : hexadecimal, octal and decimal dump of files.  --- OK
- xxd make an hexdump or do the revese.  --- OK
